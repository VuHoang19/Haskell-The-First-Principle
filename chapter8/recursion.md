## Recursion
- recursion is defining a function in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. It means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.
- Recursion is self-referential composition. We apply a funcion to an argument, then pass that result on as an argument to a second applicaiton of the same function and so on.

- the two main varieties of bottom are computations that failed with an error or those that failed to terminate.

- a partial function is one which does not handle all of its inputs
- a total function is one that does
