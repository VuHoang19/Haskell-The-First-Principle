# Haskell-The-First-Principle

## In each chapter you can expect:
- additions to your vocabulary of standard functions;
- syntactic patterns that build on each other;
- theoretical foundations so you understand how Haskell works;
- illustrative examples of how to read Haskell code;
- step-by-step demonstrations of how to write your own functions;
- explanations of how to read common error messages and how to avoid those errors;
- exercises of varying difficulty sprinkled throughout;
- definitions of important terms.
## Keep in mind
- Examples are usually designed to demonstrate, with real code
- You are intended to type all of the examples into the REPL or a file and load them
- Sometimes the examples are designed intentionally to be broken
- Not every example is designed to be entered into the REPL
- You may want to keep exercises, especially longer ones, as named modules
- Exercises at the end of the chapter may include some review questions covering material from previous chapters and are more or less ordered from least to most challenging
- Even exercises that seem easy can increase your fluency in a topic
- We ask you to write and then rewrite (using different syntax) a lot of functions
- Do not feel obligated to do all the exercises in a single sitting or even in a first pass through the chapter
- Some exercises, particularly in the earlier chapters, may seem very contrived
- Another benefit to writing code in a source file and then loading it into the REPL is that you can write comments about the process you went through in solving a problem
- Sometimes we intentionally underspecify function definitions
