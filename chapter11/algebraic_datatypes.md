- type constructors are used only at the type level, in type signatures and typeclass declaration and instances
- types are static and resolve at compile time
- data constructors construct the values at term level, values you can interact with at runtime.

- a type can be thought of as an enumeration of constructors that have zero or more arguments
- "sum" is alternation (A | B, meaning A or B but not both)
- "product" is combination (A B, meaning A and B together)
- Data constructors which take no arguments are also called nullary
- Data constructors that take one argument are called unary
- Data constructors that take more than one argument are called products
- The cardinality of a datatype is the number of possible values it defines
- A newtype cannot be a product type, sum type, or contain nullary constructor
